    "\n",
    "Given the above described situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Naive Bayes approaches assume that the features are very low correlated. If we eliminate maximum anticorrelated variables, then Naive Bayes could be used.\n",
    "+ KNN method may be risky since it suffers from the curse of dimensionality, and with small training set and high number of features may not be the best choice.\n",
    "+ Among the ensemble methods, in the literature one can find that AdaBoost and RandomForest perform similarly, so one can choose one of them and not both, not to be redundant.\n",
    "+ Logistic Regression is good for linearly separable data. It is here difficult to understand linear separability, since we have a lot of variables to play with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these premises, I adopted here the following three methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm 1: Decision Trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Advantages: They are readable and understandable, especially when they are not too deep. They are very good models for categorical features and classification purposes. They have an effective built in feature selection, since they concentrate on most informative features first, disregarding the others.\n",
    "* Disadvantages: overfitting, if they are not tuned appropriately. \n",
    "* In our problem we have a high number of categorical feature and I believe the method is suited for it.\n",

    "* Silverstein, C. and Shieber, S. M., \"Predicting individual book use for off-site storage using decision trees\". ib. Q. 6(3):266–293, 1996.

The aim is to diagnose tumors. Given a relatively high number of features, it is desired to predict what kind of tumor the patient is facing.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Advantages: They are very good for linearly separable data and reach a high degree of generalization. Moreover they deal well with small training sets and lots of features. For non linearly separable data, alternative kernels are used, allowing for non linear margins and improved classification.\n",

    "* Advantages: It is one of the basic models used for testing classifications on new problems (benchmark). There are no hyperparameters so the model is trivial to tune. Finally it is also faster than many other classification algotithms.\n",

Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
